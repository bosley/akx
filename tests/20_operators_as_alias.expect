=== Testing Operator Symbols with :as Aliasing ===

Loaded + (aliased to add)
  + 1 2 3 4 5 = 15
Loaded - (aliased to sub)
  - 10 3 = 7
Loaded * (aliased to mul)
  * 2 3 4 = 24

=== Testing Operator Composition ===
  + (* 2 3) (- 10 5) = 11
  - (+ 10 20) (* 2 3) = 24

All operator :as tests passed!
