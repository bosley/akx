Test: cons, car, cdr operations

Test 1: cons - prepend integer to list
  Result: <list>
  First element (car): 1

Test 2: cons - prepend string to list
  Result: <list>
  First element (car): a

Test 3: cons - prepend to empty list
  Result: <list>
  First element (car): 42
  Rest (cdr): nil

Test 4: car - get first element of integer list
  First element: 10

Test 5: car - get first element of string list
  First element: first

Test 6: car - get first element of mixed list
  First element: 42

Test 7: cdr - get rest of multi-element list
  Rest: <list>
  First of rest: 2

Test 8: cdr - get rest of two-element list
  Rest: <list>
  First of rest: b

Test 9: cdr - get rest of single-element list
  Rest: nil

Test 10: cons + car + cdr chain
  Car: a
  Cdr (first element): b

Test 11: nested cons operations
  First: a
  Second: b
  Third: c

Test complete.
