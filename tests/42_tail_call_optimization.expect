Test 1: Simple countdown
  Countdown from 5000 completed: 0

Test 2: Accumulator with branching
  Sum with branching: 499475

Test 3: Collatz conjecture (3n+1 problem)
  Steps to reach 1 from 9999: 91

Test 4: Fibonacci with accumulator
  fib(1000) computed (result too large to display)

PASS: All tail call optimization tests completed
