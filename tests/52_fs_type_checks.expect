Test: fs/?is-file and fs/?is-dir type checks

Test 1: Create file and directory
  Created test file and directory

Test 2: Check file type
  /tmp/akx_test_type_file.txt is file: 1
  /tmp/akx_test_type_file.txt is dir: 0

Test 3: Check directory type
  /tmp/akx_test_type_dir is file: 0
  /tmp/akx_test_type_dir is dir: 1

Test 4: Check non-existent path
  Non-existent is file: 0
  Non-existent is dir: 0

Test 5: Use type checks for conditional logic
  Confirmed: /tmp/akx_test_type_file.txt is a file
  Confirmed: /tmp/akx_test_type_dir is a directory

Test 6: Combined with fs/?exists
  Path: /tmp/akx_test_type_file.txt
    exists: 1, is-file: 1, is-dir: 0

Cleaning up...

Test complete.
