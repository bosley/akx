=== Testing :as Alias Edge Cases ===

Test 1: Loading same builtin with different symbols
  add 1 2 = 3
  + 3 4 = 7
Test 2: Reloading builtin with :as
  + 5 6 (reloaded) = 11
Test 3: Using :as with regular names
  Custom aliased println works!
Test 4: Mixing aliased and non-aliased builtins
  - 20 (add 3 4) = 13

All edge case tests passed!
