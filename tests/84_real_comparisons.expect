Test: Real number comparison operations

Test 1: real/eq equality
  5.5 == 5.5: 1
  5.5 == 5.6: 0
  3.0 == 3.0 == 3.0: 1

Test 2: real/neq inequality
  5.5 != 6.5: 1
  5.5 != 5.5: 0
  1.0 != 2.0 != 3.0: 1

Test 3: real/gt greater than
  10.5 > 5.5: 1
  5.5 > 10.5: 0
  5.5 > 5.5: 0

Test 4: real/gte greater than or equal
  10.5 >= 5.5: 1
  5.5 >= 5.5: 1
  5.5 >= 10.5: 0

Test 5: real/lt less than
  5.5 < 10.5: 1
  10.5 < 5.5: 0
  5.5 < 5.5: 0

Test 6: real/lte less than or equal
  5.5 <= 10.5: 1
  5.5 <= 5.5: 1
  10.5 <= 5.5: 0

Test complete.
