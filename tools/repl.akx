; The default core wraps up most of nucleus, but not IO
; So we need to import the IO nucleus to get print and println
import "$AKX_HOME/stdlib/io.akx"

; Other functionality and customizations to the REPL can be made
; by defininf functions here and perfoming and pre-jit loading of system-specific 
; module extensions

; A simple welcome to show that we have loaded prelude repl.akx
;

let welcome (lambda []
  (println "Custom REPL environment loaded!"))
